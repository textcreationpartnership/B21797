            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

And whereas the Lords Commissioners of His Majesties Treasury, pursuant to the last mentioned Act, have placed the Management of the said Duties upon Leather, and the Execution of the said Act in the Commissioners and Governours for Management of the Receipt of Excise for the time being, and in Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors, Surveyors and Officers to be appointed by them, or the major part of them, who by the Laws relating to the Excise are obliged to keep an Office open in every Market Town on every Market Day: We taking into Consideration that the Methods prescribed by the above recited Act, have, of late Days, been very much Neglected and Disused, especially as to the Buying and Selling of Leather in open Fairs and Markets, and being sensible that the due Performance and Execution of the said Act will very much tend not only to the Ease, Benefit and Advantage of all His Majesties Loving Subjects, Traders and Dealers in Leather, and the General Good and Publick Service of the Realm, but to the better Ascertaining, Charging and Collecting of the Duties on Leather Granted by the said Act; And to the end no Person or Persons in the above Recited Acts mentioned may through Ignorance incur any of the Penalties thereby Inflicted, Have thought fit, by the Advice of His Majesties Privy Council, to Publish this Proclamation; And We do hereby Declare, That all Mayors, Bailiffs, and other Head Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers for the time being, in the several Cities, Boroughs, Market Towns, and also the respective Lords of Liberties, Fairs and Markets, and all others whom it may concern within this Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> and Town of <hi>Berwick</hi> upon <hi>Tweed,</hi> that they and every of them in their respective Places and Stations, do take effectual Care, that the above mentioned Statute made in the said First Year of the said King <hi>James</hi> the First, and all the Clauses, Matters and Things therein contained, in relation to the Tanning, Tawing, Dressing, Making, Buying, Selling, Searching, Trying, Sealing, Registring, and all other Matters concerning Leather, be forthwith put in due Execution, other than such as have been Alter'd by any Law or Statute since that time made, and now in Force; And that from henceforth all Leather Taw'd, Dressed or Made with Oyl, Allom, Salt, or any other Materials, commonly called, White Leather, except as in the said Act made in the last Session of Parliament is excepted, as also all Tann'd Leather made in Wooze, commonly called, Red Leather, for which the said Duties are to be paid, be Sold in Open Fairs and Markets, according to the Direction of the said Acts, and not else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. And We do hereby Declare and Appoint for the greater Ease and Convenience of His Majesties Subjects, That the respective Lords and Owners of Liberties, Fairs and Markets, do appoint and make Publication of the certain Time and Place in which only any sort of Leather shall or may be Bought or Sold, or offer'd to Sale within their respective Markets, Fairs, and Iurisdictions. And We do hereby further Publish and Declare, That all Tanners, Tawers, Curriers, Makers or Dressers of Leather, giving their Notices, Entring their Leather, Registring the same, and Paying the Duties according to the Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the said Act, at the next Office of Excise for the time being, for the Market-Town or Place next their respective Tan-houses or Work-houses, or with the Officer appointed for such Excise Office, will thereby avoid the Penalties Inflicted by the said Act. Provided nevertheless, That where any Leather shall be Sold at any Fair, the same must on Sale thereof be Registred with, and the Duties Paid to the Officer appointed for such Fair.
